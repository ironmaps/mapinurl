            <h4>Why mapinurl?</h4>
            <p>Many a times, I've wished to share some location data with friends/family and other tools on the internet
                are too <i>extravagant</i> for tiny personal usecases.</p>
            <p>With "mapinurl", your data stays with you (literally in the URL), and eventually with people and machines you share this URL with.</p>
            <p>You can use it to generate small maps to embed in class-notes, maps to share weekend hiking trails with friends, etc.</p>
            <p>Currently it supports only data generated in the webpage, since it's not <i>meant</i> to be used to work with a 100MB GeoJSON. :) But I'll add some support soon.</p>
            <p>Of course, like everything this has its own <b>drawbacks</b>. Since the link contains the actual data, they are very long.</p>
            <h4>How to use?</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Draw shapes, and add notes to shapes by clicking on them.
                </li>
                <li>Use the toolbar on the left to select shapes while drawing</li>
                <li>Edit tooltip notes(doesn't require a manual save from toolbar). Edit/delete geometries.</li>
                <li>The link displayed in the bottom and <code>Copy link to Map</code> button can be used to get a shareable link to this map.</li>
